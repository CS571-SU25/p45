                The U.S. Travel Wishlist was created to help people keep track of the states they want to explore and celebrate the ones they’ve already visited. Whether you're planning a road trip across the country or just dreaming of your next vacation, this app helps you organize and visualize your travel goals.

                This project was built with simplicity in mind — offering an easy way to add states, write travel notes, and mark destinations as visited, and even add a little image as background for memories. It’s designed for curious travelers, students working on portfolio projects, and anyone who loves checking places off a list.

                Built using React, the app runs entirely in the browser, with no account or login required. Your list is saved locally on your device so you can return anytime and pick up where you left off.
